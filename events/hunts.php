  <h1>Hunts</h1>
  <p>Here at Nai's Glory, we like to have fun events called hunts. They are structured 
    role plays that involve about 5 Trainers going out into the Nai's Glory Lands 
    with their Naisuk and finding addition items or even Naisuk! </p>
  <p>We've done a few already and Bright Promise tries to hold a hunt once or 
    twice a year, depending on time commitments.</p>
  <p>We use the Nai's Glory role playing board to hold this event. The game is 
    run by the players essentially. They post a reply after Bright Promise describes 
    the setting and they are free to use &quot;turns&quot; to make moves around 
    the given playing field.</p>
