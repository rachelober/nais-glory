  <h2>Personality</h2>
  <p>Hey everyone reading this, my name is Mirab. I am an older Eorlan than has 
    been in Rhul for a while, still haven't grown up yet, which isn't a problem 
    really. Being a pup still, you can weasel out of everything! *snickers at 
    Bright Promise* If I were an adult, I wouldn't have nearly the kind of influence 
    as I do now. Like Garret? He tries to get away with the dumbest things! Bright 
    Promise pulls out the lecture and <i>always</i> says, &quot;Garret! You should 
    know better! You're an <i>ADULT</i> for cryin' out loud!&quot; Ha-ha!</p>
  <p>Besides my pup-ness, I am a Water elemental and loving it. I can't wait to 
    learn all those attacks out there for me to use!</p>
