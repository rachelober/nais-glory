  <h2>Personality</h2>
  <p>Hey there! My name is Konati and I am a cloud element. And I have wings! 
    Aren't wings great? I really do love them. I argue with Mirab sometimes because 
    she thinks wings are useless in battle and that Water would beat Cloud anyday. 
    ... I guess that might be true, but we've never battled each other, and I 
    don't think I ever do!! She'd be too mean about it, really. But really, she 
    is a nice individual who took well to her Water element, real easy going but 
    she does like picking on me... *pout*</p>
  <p>Nericcia is my best friend! She is SO nice and caring. I wish she would have 
    wings so we could go flying together! ^_^ She also has this <i>beautiful</i> 
    cape that Adonia gave her a while ago... which I guess would make it hard 
    for her to go flying with me... oh well.</p>
  <p>Other than that, I love making new friends, soaring through the sky and enjoying 
    the day!</p>
