  <h2>Personality</h2>
  <p>Wow, I get to talk about myself here? Ha! Get a load of this Iern!</p>
  <p>Well, I came here not too long ago to Rhul and I am the first Iernati in 
    the land, which I guess is something to be proud of, or envied... maybe... 
    if there were other Iernati here to look up to me, but since there isn't, 
    I will have to look for lesser beings to adorn me. *looks over at rock* Hello 
    rock, care to join me? err...</p>
  <p>Anyway, I love good luck charms, but the hundreds. I swear, some of the things 
    I've picked up along my travels are incredibly rare and <i>lucky</i> so don't 
    touch! They are mine and you will <i>never</i> find them... *thinks* I also 
    hope Bright Promise doesn't find them, she might make me give them back...</p>
  <p>Err, off topic again. I plan to make a super huge good luck charm one day, 
    collecting only the best materials for my creation, that will lead me to the 
    elusive... &quot;Pot 'o Gold&quot; I've heard in many a' tales... Yes...</p>
  <p>And for the young females out there: I enjoy romps in the desert sand, a 
    cool breeze and lovely company.</p>
  <h2>Plans</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Good Luck Charm Tattoos (four leaf clover, shoe horn) </li>
    <li> Jackalope horns </li>
    <li> White Marking additions - make his tail tip white </li>
  </ul>
