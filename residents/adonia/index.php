  <h2>Personality</h2>
  <p>Well, there isn't much to say about me, really. I was the first Eorlan here, 
    but by no means the most special. I do think Bright Promise looks up to me 
    to guide the other Eorlan here to victory and it is quite some paws to fill, 
    I must say.</p>
  <p>I am the Leader of the Tribe of Swirling Magic, you can add that to my resume 
    too!</p>
  <p>And if you haven't noticed, I am a Starlight Elemental and really enjoying 
    it. My most favorite addition would have to be my horn. I was so excited, 
    and I have to look back on this with much fondness of my pup days, when Bright 
    Promise brought home a wonderful, silver horn; and it was just for me.</p>
  <p>My best friend would have to be Garret. Us two have stuck around since the 
    early days and have seen many new battlers entering Rhul as well as the birth 
    of Nai's Glory. Even though Garret and I look out for each other, I don't 
    think we would ever make appropriate mates, seeing as how I think of him as 
    a brother. I am not too sure if I see puppies in my future, but it is always 
    a possibility!</p>
  <p>I also care for my kitty, Meekus. She is a darling creature that always says 
    the right things, just when I need it. She usually follows me to battle and 
    keeps me compant when I am lonely, which is not too often since there are 
    so many pups and cubs running around here lately!</p>
  <h2>Meekus</h2>
  <p><img src="meekus.gif" alt="Meekus" width="44" height="81"></p>
  <p>Name: Meekus<br>
    Gender: Female<br>
    Color: Rose<br>
    Markings: Pink tail tip and forhead.<br>
    Price: 35 quox<br>
    Owner: Adonia<br>
    From: Amaryllis</p>
  <p>Meekus is an inquisitive cat and doesn't like to lay around as most other 
    cats do. She stays by Adonia's side all the time now and even whenever she 
    is meeting with members of the Tribe of Swirling Magic.</p>
  <h2>Plans</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> More Starlight attacks </li>
    <li> Fur Mutation (long leg fur) </li>
    <li> Maybe another silver horn? </li>
  </ul>
