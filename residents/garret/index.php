  <h2>Personality</h2>
  <p>Ugh, why are you making me do this? What! I <i>have</i> to? I don't <b><i>have</i></b> 
    to do anything! EEK! Don't hurt beanie! Err... umm...</p>
  <p>I guess I am the cool and staoic individual that most Dual Ice/Winds are... 
    if there are any other duals out there with that nature, I don't know, I haven't 
    been looking...</p>
  <p>I like to battle, I like being strong and I like being intimidating. It is 
    a hard world out there and I best be ready for anything and no weakness, none. 
    I mean, really, who would want to go up against a baddy like me who can breathe 
    ice? Really?</p>
  <p>Other than that, I hang out with Adonia on occassion. She was here before 
    me and the only other being here older than me (except Bright Promise *snicker*). 
    My next in command would have to be Sandrine, she is encredibly concerned 
    with her battle and honor. Together, I think the two of us, with Adonia leading 
    of course, could make a really strong Tribe.</p>
  <h2>Plans</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> More powerful attacks!!! </li>
    <li> To look BADASS </li>
  </ul>
