  <h2>Personality</h2>
  <p>Mmm... yes. I don't like these things, really. You should really ask me in 
    person what I am like. But I'll tell you a few things, just to keep you guessing.</p>
  <p>My name is Yoshiaki. I like the cold wind, autumn and sadness. Seems kind 
    of contradicting, no? To like sad. How come no one understands me? NO ONE 
    DOES!</p>
  <p>...</p>
  <p>*quiet again* But really, I get over it. I find solice in myself and stay 
    outside most of the time, enjoying the night sky and spirits in the air.</p>

    <li> Element of Death </li>
    <li> Hair Mutations (Feet) </li>
    <li> Possible Tail Mutation (Fury and Long) </li>
