  <h2>Personality</h2>
  <p>Oh, how do I work this thing?? Ugh, well alright... hi there! ^.^ I am Nericcia 
    and I am the Steel Elemental of the group here at Rhul! I love to be out in 
    the sunshine and run around and play all day! Plus, I have a cape! ZOOM! I 
    will be a super-hero yet! And get this, I got it all from my bestest friend, 
    Adonia! She came home from a quest one day and said, &quot;Here Nericcia, 
    you are so sweet and kind and fun and great and wonderful so have this cape!&quot; 
    Ok, well maybe the conversation didn't go <i>really</i> like that, but it 
    was close!</p>
  <p>My <i>other</i> bestest friend, Konati says he is going to teach me how to 
    fly. I don't know <i>how</i> though! I mean, well of course I don't know <i>how</i> 
    to fly, but I don't know <i>how</i> he is going to teach me, c'mon! I don't 
    have any wings. But <i>maybe</i> my cape will become magically enchanted and 
    then I can zoom around and leave little sparkles when I fly over someone's 
    head! ZOOM!</p>
  <p>My time is up? What? No, not yet, BP! Let me add one more thing! I am always 
    looking for more friends! So please come and visit me sometime! I like bestest 
    friends!!</p>
