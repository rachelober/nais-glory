  <h2>Personality</h2>
  <p>Hmm, yes. Good day to you! My name is Sandrine, it is a pleasure to meet 
    you, very. You don't get much of your kind around here. Anyway, I am glad 
    you came to meet me!</p>
  <p>I spend most of my days training, I believe the best thing in my life is 
    toguard and protect. It is my duty to look over the younger ones in my Tribe 
    and make sure they always feel safe. Therefore, I always must be strong and 
    ready if trouble ever comes our way.</p>
  <p>I think some of the other critters here think I take it too seriously though. 
    They'll see when someone comes along to scare them all. Well, i really hope 
    that won't happen, but I am ready.</p>
