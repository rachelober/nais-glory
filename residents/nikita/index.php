  <h2>Personality</h2>
  <p>*blink* ... &gt;_&gt; ... &lt;_&lt; ... FIRE!</p>
  <p>*coughs with a puff of smoke* No! BP I swear I haven't been smoking again! 
    *looks around* Ok, see, I have to do this thing that if I see something cool... 
    I have to light it on fire. 'Cause, you know... it is cool like that.</p>
  <p>*looks around* Umm... I like to run around with fire. And set things on fire. 
    BP says she can't let me in the forest anymore because I am an idiot around 
    wood. Pshh, whatever that means!</p>
  <p>The best person to hang around with here is probably Sandrine or Konati. 
    Konati can get weird at time, we use to hang out a lot as pups but he prefers 
    to be up in the air these days *rolls eyes*. Sandine is cool, althought she 
    is a girl, but I always like battling her, even if I lose most of the time.</p>
