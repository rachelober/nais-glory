  <h2>Personality</h2>
  <p>Yes, yes. Glad to meet you all and all that jazz. I am the wonderful, amazing 
    Tabia that I am sure you have all heard about. I have class, style and amazing 
    good looks! Not to mention the talent one needs to have this day in age to 
    get where they want to go.</p>
  <p>Where I want to go? Well, I <i>guess</i> be a good battler. But my real dream 
    is to be the prettiest pup out there! When I grow up, I will be the prettiest 
    female in the Tribe and have all the boys want me. That's just the way it 
    goes I suppose!</p>
  <p>My common interest really lies with Ajeya. I can tell her anything and she 
    will always agree with me.We love to collect pretty objects together, especially 
    jewelry. I think she gets too obsessed with that sometimes, she should work 
    on that coat of hers, but oh well. No one is perfect!</p>
  <h2>Plans for Tabia</h2>

    <li> Element of Earth </li>
    <li> Hair Mutation (Fluffy Tail?) </li>
    <li> Thick Coat (Maybe a long Coat instead?) </li>
    <li> Claws </li>
    <li> Fangs </li>
  </ul>
