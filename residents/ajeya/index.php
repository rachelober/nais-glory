  <h2>Personality</h2>
  <p>Umm, what can I say about myself other than I am cute Naisuk with fantastic 
    jewelry sense and a wonderful personality? :D</p>
  <p>My best friend here in Rhul would have to be Tabia, we just share so many 
    interests, like boys, jewelry, style, colors and outlook on life! All the 
    other girls around here are too concerned with training and really should 
    lighten up a little, battling isn't always about beating yourself to death! 
    You should look back and congratulate yourself for a job well done, fix what 
    needs to be fixed and try again.</p>
  <p>I am really looking forward to maybe getting an ear mutation to make my ears 
    bigger. After a met a Cyen not too long ago, it really fell in love with their 
    elegance and swiftness. I wouldn't mind having one of their tails either! 
    Other than those two things, the obligatory jewelry is always a favorite of 
    mine, especially if it has jewels!</p>
  <h2>Plans</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> More jewelry! </li>
    <li> Glory Attacks </li>
    <li> Long Fur </li>
    <li> Claws </li>
  </ul>
