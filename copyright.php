  <h2>NRBC Battle System</h2>
  <p>Eorlan and the <a href="http://battles.indyslair.net/nrbc.htm">NRBC</a> Battle 
    System for Naisuk were created, developed and maintained by Rachel "Indyana" 
    Gratis originally for the Eorlan. The original web site for the Eorlan is 
    <a href="http://battles.indyslair.net/">found here</a>.</p>
  <p>The Naisuk have been approved by Rachel &quot;Indyana&quot; Gratis for use 
    by Bright Promise to use the NRBC Battle System. Naisuk are to be used in 
    conjunction with the Eorlan and et al. at the <a href="http://p205.ezboard.com/bnowhererealm">Nowhere 
    Realm</a>.</p>
  <p>Bright Promise does not take credit for these ideas and instead would like 
    to use the Naisuk to expand the grandeur of Eorlan and the NRBC Battle System.</p>
