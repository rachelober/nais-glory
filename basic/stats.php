  <h1>Basic: Stats</h1>
  <p><i>Stats are assigned exactly like the all NRBC affiliates, if you have already 
    read an affiliate's Basic Stats page, you can skip this section.</i></p>
  <p>Everything should be similar to the Eorlan as far as calculating stats like 
    Life Points, Strength, Speed, Intelligence, Cunning and Defense. Attack will 
    be balanced to Eorlan attacks, however will be similar, yet different to fit 
    the Naisuk.</p>
  <p>Stat additions will occur every three months at the change of the season. 
    This is about the same time frame as the Eorlan, so the two species should 
    be growing at the same pace.</p>
  <p>Stats are the lifeblood of Naisuk battling and growth, so it is vital that 
    you understand what each portion does and how this affects your Naisuk.</p>
  <p>When you join Nai's Glory, you will receive your first Naisuk along with 
    a stat table that will look similar to this:</p>
  <p>Life Points: 100</p>
  <p>Strength: 30<br>
    Speed: 40<br>
    Intelligence: 30<br>
    Cunning: 35<br>
    Defense: 20</p>
  <p>Attacks:<br>
    Bellow -- lowers Defense of opponent by 10% of original value each time used<br>
    Gnaw -- 30 Damage</p>
  <p>Life Points -- This should be pretty self-explanatory. When battling, your 
    goal is to get your opponent's Life Points down to 0 before your Naisuk's. 
    Most Naisuk pups start at 100 Life Points. More Life Points will be awarded 
    to Naisuk periodically by the Charm Leader, as based on their battle activity. 
    During a battle, Life Points are taken away by attacks from an opponent. They 
    are reset to the original value after every battle is over.</p>
  <p>Strength -- Strength tells you many important things to remember when battling 
    your Naisuk. If you divide the value by 10, you get a number of turns (in 
    this case, 30/10 = 3). If this number is a decimal for some reason, it gets 
    rounded (.4 and below rounded down, .5 and above rounded up). This number 
    has two uses:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> This is the number of turns your Naisuk can play before its defense lowers 
      by 10% the original value. For our sample, this means that at the end of 
      its third turn, the Naisuk's defense will drop to 18 (20 - [10% of 20]). 
      Then, at the end of its sixth turn, its defense will drop to 16 (18 - [10% 
      of 20]). And so on until the battle has ended. </li>
    <li> Also, this is the number of damaging attacks your Naisuk can make in 
      a row. For example, a damaging attack is Gnaw (30 damage), while Bellow 
      is a non-damaging attack. This Naisuk could use Gnaw three times before 
      it must use its non-damaging attack, Bellow. This applies to any combination 
      of damaging attacks. For example, an older Naisuk with different attacks 
      but still 30 Strength, could use Gnaw, Strike, and Drive (all damaging attacks), 
      but then on its fourth turn, it would have to use a non-damaging attack, 
      or, if it does not have one, rest a turn. You can &quot;reset&quot; the 
      turns at any time by using a non-damaging attack (for example, you could 
      do Gnaw, Bellow, Gnaw, Gnaw, Gnaw). </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Speed -- Speed, first of all, tells which creature goes first in a battle. 
    The creature with the highest speed goes first. If the two creatures are equal, 
    than the owner of the creature that issued the battle challenge must flip 
    a coin. Heads, and the opponent goes first; tails and your Naisuk goes first. 
    One flip, one answer; not two out of three or any such nonsense. This is an 
    honor-system move, and it is considered a grave dishonor to lie about the 
    flip of a coin. As a battler, you must learn to accept rules, even if they 
    are not to your advantage! I trust that anyone who comes to this situation 
    will flip a coin and tell the truth about the results. Speed also figures 
    into Cunning, which will be mentioned later.</p>
  <p>Intelligence -- Intelligence is the second factor in Cunning. Intelligence 
    also gives you a pricing level for all attack purchases. Here are the price 
    level divisions:<br>
    0-49 = Level 1<br>
    50-99 = Level 2<br>
    100 and up = Level 3<br>
    The higher this level, the lower your cost. The theory behind this is that 
    intelligent Naisuk will learn moves more easily than those of less intelligence, 
    and thus, intelligence is rewarded.</p>
  <p>Cunning -- This stat is the average of the Speed and Intelligence stats ([40+30]/2 
    = 35). This stat then determines a turn number, but in a different way than 
    other stats. Here is the grid for Cunning stats:<br>
    0-49 = 5 turns<br>
    50-149 = 4 turns<br>
    150-199 = 3 turns<br>
    200 and up = 2 turns<br>
    For this example, we will use our sample stats. Cunning of 35 falls within 
    the 5 turn range. This means that every 5 turns, this Naisuk gets to attack 
    twice in one turn. (So, on its 5th, 10th, 15th, etc. turn). The reasoning 
    behind this is that the faster, smarter Naisuk will be able to get in attacks 
    more often than a slower or less intelligent Naisuk.</p>
  <p>Defense -- This stat is fairly obvious. This number represents the defense 
    of the Naisuk. Half of this value is taken away from the Damage issued by 
    attacks. For example, if another Naisuk attacked this sample Naisuk with Gnaw 
    (30 Damage), then half of the Defense stat would be subtracted from the damage 
    (30 - [20/2] = 20). The Gnaw would only do 20 damage instead of 30. Now, right 
    now, you must be thinking that these battles will go slowly, and this is true. 
    We want to give time for factors like Strength and Cunning to come into play, 
    not have the battle end in four turns. Also, don't forget that larger attacks 
    with more damage can be purchased. Gnaw and Bellow are just cub attacks.</p>
  <p>Attacks -- Now, finally, we get beyond the base stats and reach the Naisuk's 
    attacks. These are pretty easy to understand. Some attacks do damage (Gnaw 
    -- 30 damage). Other attacks have different effects (Bellow -- lowers opponent's 
    Defense by 10% of original value each time). So, if our Naisuk used Gnaw (30 
    damage) on another Naisuk with a Defense of 20, than the damage would be 20 
    (30 - [20/2] = 20). If our Naisuk used Bellow, than the effect would be that 
    the opponent's Defense would drop to 18 (20 - [10% of 20] = 18). If our Naisuk 
    used Bellow again later, it would subtract another 2 points (10% of 20). The 
    attacks and their effects become more complicated when elements are involved, 
    but since these aren't available to Naisuk just starting out, we'll leave 
    that discussion for later.</p>
