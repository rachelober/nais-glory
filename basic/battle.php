  <h1>Basic: Battle</h1>
  <p>Make sure you've read all previous sections in the Basic category and any 
    other information you were directed to at Eorl's Honor!</p>
  <p><i>If you've read about Basic Battle at any of the affiliates, you can skip 
    this section because Basic Battle is the same for all affiliates.</i></p>
  <p>Battling is the best way to help your Naisuk grow more powerful and to gain 
    experience. After a few months of battling, Stat Awards will be given that 
    can improve your Naisuk's Life Points and Stats (like Strength, Speed, Intelligence 
    and Defense). When Stat Awards are ready to be awarded, a post will be made 
    in the Nai's Glory Updates forum.</p>
  <p>The two different kind of point values are <b>Life Points</b> and <b>Experience 
    Points</b>.</p>
  <p>Life Points are to be added to your Naisuk's current Life Point value.</p>
  <p>Experience Points are a little more tricky! These can be divided up in groups 
    of 5 or 10 to be added to your base stats (Strength, Speed, Intelligence and 
    Defense). Experience Points can not be divided into groups less than 5 and 
    no more than 10 Experience Points can be assigned to a specific base stat. 
    As an example, if your Naisuk was awarded 15 Experience Points, he could put 
    10 into Intelligence and 5 into Defense, or 5 into Strength, 5 into Speed 
    and 5 into Defense.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Experience Points <b>can not</b> be put into Cunning because Cunning 
      is an average of the Speed and Intelligence base stats. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Starting a battle</h2>
  <p>Battles occur on the Battlefield and are issued by the challenger. You can 
    start one by creating a new topic with this sort of convention: &quot;Battle: 
    [Your Naisuk's name] vs ??&quot;. That lets other trainers know that your 
    Naisuk is ready for a battle.</p>
  <p>If you would like to make a quox or item wager, you need to offer that in 
    your first post.</p>
  <p>You can also offer prizes to people that challenge you with the requisite 
    that they beat you, such as &quot;I will award 20q to you if you can beat 
    me&quot;.</p>
  <p>Don't forget to post your stats in your first post. If you don't post this, 
    trainers have no idea what they are up against. Something like this is sufficient:</p>

  <p>Ajeya<br>
    <a href="http://mintkiss.net/elaria/nrbc/ajeya/index.php" target="_blank">http://mintkiss.net/battles/residents/ajeya.php</a><br>
    <br>
    Life Points: 100<br>
    Strength: 30 (every 3 turns, my Defense drops 10% of original; I may only 
    use three damaging attacks in a row before I must rest or use a non-damaging 
    attack)<br>
    Speed: 40<br>
    Intelligence: 30<br>
    Cunning: 35 (every 5 turns I may attack twice in one turn)<br>
    Defense: 20<br>
    <br>
    Attacks:<br>
    Gnaw -- 30 Damage<br>
    Bellow -- lowers Defense of opponent by 10% of original value each time used</p>
  <p>Whenever someone has accepted your challenge, remember to always update your 
    topic title with the name of the opponent you are battling against. </p>
  <p>You can also accept someone else's challenge. In order to do this, you make 
    a reply to that person's challenge and state that you accept the challenge 
    and any terms/wager/bets involved. You also must post your Naisuk's name,page 
    address, and stat table (with explanations).</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Naisuk can battle any other creature as long as they are within the same 
      age group. This means that cubs can only battle other cubs (puppies etc.) 
      and adults can only battle adults. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once two creatures have agreed to battle, the one with the higher speed goes 
    first. If the two creatures are equal in Speed, than the owner of the creature 
    that issued the battle challenge must flip a coin. Heads, and the opponent 
    goes first; tails and owner's own creature goes first. The creature that goes 
    first must post its first attack/move (ex. &quot;Ajeya uses Gnaw (30 Damage).&quot;) 
    Then, it is the other creature's turn.</p>
  <p>The other must first repost its stat table, with alterations for the damage. 
    If Ajeya was fighting a Naisuk with Life Points: 100 and Defense: 30, then 
    her Gnaw attack would do 30 Damage - opponent's Defense/2, or 30 - (30/2) 
    = 30 - (15) = 15. Her attack would do 15 Damage. The other Naisuk would repost 
    his stat table, and his Life Points would then be 85 (100-15).</p>
  <p>After reposting his stat table, the opponent would also state his move/attack 
    for his turn.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>Some Important Notes on Rounding</b><br>
      If you have defense that does not divide evenly (i.e. 25), then you go through 
      the damage formula like so: 30 Damage - (Defense: 25/2) = 30 - (12.5) = 
      17.5. This number is rounded up to 18 Damage, which is then subtracted from 
      your Life.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The order of rounding matter</b>s. Why is it rounded in this order? Because 
      the way the formula is set up. If you had a scientific calculator, the first 
      number you would see would be 17.5 (the number inside the parentheses, 12.5, 
      would not be rounded), and so 17.5 is the number you round, not the defense 
      divided by two (12.5), or the Life Points afterwards. <b>Just remember that 
      you are calculating Damage, so your round the final Damage, not the Life 
      Points</b>.<br>
      <br>
      This rounding issue also applies to Defense drops if your Defense doesn't 
      divide equally. For example, 10% of 25 is 2.5. If you were doing your first 
      Defense drop, the formula would be 25 - (10% of 25) = 25 - (2.5) = 22.5, 
      which rounds up to 23. You do not round the number in the parentheses (2.5), 
      you round the final Defense (22.5).<br>
      <br>
      Be very careful about the rounding orders. For Damage, you round the final 
      Damage, before you subtract it from Life Points. For Defense, you round 
      the final Defense.<br>
      <br>
      Make sure you're rounding is correct, your opponent doesn't need to correct 
      you if the mistake favors their Naisuk!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In battle, the creatures trade turns until one reaches Life Points: 0. You 
    must remember, however, to apply the effects of your creature's Strength and 
    Cunning. When battling Ajeya, her Strength (30) indicates that at the end 
    of every 3rd turn, you would have to remember to lower her Defense by 2 points 
    (10% of 20). Also, you must remember never to use damaging attacks more than 
    three times in a row. Her Cunning (35) indicates that every 5th turn you would 
    have to remember that you could attack twice.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>A Note on Defense Effects</b><br>
      For Defense, the &quot;original Defense&quot; for moves like Bellow and 
      other Defense deductions is the Defense you start with. This is not to be 
      confused with your &quot;base stat&quot; for Defense. Some items will augment 
      your base Defense stat, giving your creature higher original Defense. For 
      example, on an individual with Defense: 36 (Base: 30 + 20% from Back Spines), 
      you use 10% of 36 for the deductions, not 10% of 30. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Battling Conventions</h2>
  <p>Please only have your Naisuk fighting in one battle at a time (as it wouldn't 
    make sense to be fighting two at once...).  Also, please try to reply to posts 
    as soon as you can, so the battles don't drag on for too long.  To see an 
    example battle, please visit the Battlefield and check out the Instruction 
    and Training section.  Also, feel free to watch other battles going on at 
    the Battlefield.</p>
  <p>Once you've gotten the hang of battling, it can be great fun!  You can buy 
    attacks and items to help your Naisuk grow and battle more effectively. Also, 
    once your Naisuk has learned an element spell, it can learn elemental attacks 
    and participate in elemental battles, which are discussed in the "Advanced" 
    section of this site. Here are some important basic rules to remember when 
    battling:</p>
  <h2>Rules of the Battlefield</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> When issuing a challenge, post required stats with descriptions, battling 
      conditions, and a clear link to your Naisuk's page. Posting a picture is 
      also helpful. </li>
    <li> When accepting a challenge, post required stats with descriptions, acceptance 
      of any battling conditions, and provide a clear link to your Naisuk's page. 
      Posting a picture is also helpful. </li>
    <li> <b>*Note on Posting Images*</b> If your server allows image direct linking, 
      you can put your Naisuk's picture in your first post. To do so, use an image 
      ezboard tag:<br>
      <i>[img noborder]http://yourweb/yourimage.gif[/img]</i><br>
      If you know your server does not allow direct linking (or, if you try this 
      with the correct url for your image and the image still won't show up), 
      you can get permission to direct link from my server. This is ONLY for use 
      on The Nowhere Realm (our message board) and its forums; no direct linking 
      from any other web sites, please. You can request permission and your image 
      url by contacting me (via email: <img src="../images/email.gif" width="115" height="12"> 
      or AIM: Bright Promise). </li>
    <li> Unanswered battle challenges will be deleted after a month. </li>
    <li> Once two Naisuk agree to battle, the original poster must edit the title 
      of the first post and change it to reflect the battle (ex. "Battle: Ajeya 
      vs. Sweetness"). </li>
    <li> Battles, once begun, have a limited time to conclude. Battles with long 
      periods of inactivity (a week or more) will be warned by the Charm Leaders 
      and ended a week later. Exceptions will be made if a good excuse is posted 
      and <u>both</u> battlers agree to let the battle go on.<br>
      <br>
      If neither party replies to a Warned battle, the battle will be ended as 
      a "draw" or "tie" in your Naisuk's battle records. If only one party replies, 
      then that person's Naisuk will be proclaimed as the winner, as the other 
      Naisuk will have "withdrawn" from the fight and lost.<br>
      <br>
      If your Naisuk start to accumulate too many draws, the Charm Leaders may 
      have a chat with you. If your Naisuk withdraws from a match without agreement 
      with the other trainer in the battle, the match counts as a win for your 
      opponent and a loss for your Naisuk. </li>
    <li> In battle, watch your math and rounding! Your opponents are not required 
      to correct you, especially if the mistake is in their favor. Read over the 
      battle instructions here if you have questions. You can also post your question 
      in the Instruction and Training forum or contact me (via email: <img src="../images/email.gif" width="115" height="12"> 
      or AIM: Bright Promise). </li>
    <li> When a battle is over, the original poster must edit the title of the 
      first post and add "-- Finished" to the end of it (ex. "Battle: Ajeya vs. 
      Sweetness -- Finished"). This is so the Charm Leaders know to archive the 
      battle. </li>
    <li> It is very helpful to post a summary at the top of the first post in the 
      battle after the battle has ended. Here is an example:<br>
      <br>
      Winner: Ajeya<br>
      Battle lasted 8 turns<br>
      <br>
      Other information you could include would be a prize or wager given or collected, 
      any Naisuk watching the battle, especially cubbies, and any other useful 
      archiving information. </li>
    <li> After battles are marked as "-- Finished" by the battlers, they will be 
      closed and moved to the Battle Archives forum. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you have questions or need help, please go to The Battlefield and post 
    in the Instruction and Training forum, or directly contact me (via email: 
    <img src="../images/email.gif" width="115" height="12"> or AIM: Bright Promise).</p>
