  <h1>Basic: Naisuk Fact Page</h1>
  <h2>Territory</h2>
  <p>Naisuk (plural is Naisuk) were found in the North of Rhul on the island of 
    Crykst which is a mild environment of both cold and warm temperatures that 
    depends on which part of the island you travel on. Most Naisuk prefer colder 
    habitats like polar bears.</p>
  <p>This species from Rhul is also found near the base of the Eldora mountains 
    and spreads into the uppermost of Arube (not near Hearth) and this is where 
    most of the Naisuk from Nai's Glory are from.</p>
  <p>Naisuk like to have a personal territory of about 100 square feet as cubs 
    (that may or may not overlap slightly with other cubs), as cubbies they usually 
    like huddling with other cubbies and cubs, so territory is not a big deal 
    to them then. As they grow older, they become more accomplished by gaining 
    more territory through battles and hunting.</p>
  <p>If they are within a Sleuth, a Naisuk is more than likely going to share 
    his/her territory with the entire Sleuth.</p>
  <h2>Diet</h2>
  <p>Naisuk prefer eating a variety of foods. When small prey, like rabbits, (or 
    even cyen O.O) are available, they will choose meat, provided that they can 
    catch them.</p>
  <p>Before winter, they will choose harvest berries and plants to munch on if 
    this is available. They have been known to be devious enough to pillage through 
    farming country and pick off tasty crops.</p>
  <h2>Body Facts</h2>
  <p>Naisuk have a thick fur and a good layer of fat. This does not hinder their 
    speed in battle but if they were to run long distances, they would tire much 
    quicker.</p>
  <p>They are born with an averaged weight of 3-5lbs and a length from snout to 
    tail of about half a foot. They are born with thin hair covering their body 
    and this hair insulates their body and is soon shed after the first month 
    of infancy. After this they are considered cubbies and can wander around further 
    away from their mothers.</p>
  <p>Cubbies usually range from 20-30lbs and grow to be about 2ft in length and 
    stand a foot and a half when standing on all fours and then about 2-3ft on 
    their hind legs. Cubbies are <b>not allowed</b> to battle on their Battlefield, 
    instead they are asked to watch battles to gain experience. This will help 
    them to grow into cubs.</p>
  <p>Cubs can get up to about 70lbs and are about 3 1/2ft in length and stand 
    about 3ft when standing on all fours and about 4ft when balancing on their 
    hind legs. This age is when Naisuk can begin battling on the Battlefield.</p>
  <p>Adults range between the females and males of the species with males being 
    slightly larger. They can get up to 150lbs for the females and 250lbs for 
    the males which is a lot of weight if they fall on you! They can stand up 
    to 6ft in height on their hind legs and are about 4-5ft when standing on all 
    fours. When Naisuk become adults, they are then able to breed and have cubbies.</p>
