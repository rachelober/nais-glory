  <h1>Basic: Charms</h1>
  <p>Charms are the Naisuk counterpart of the Eorlan Clan. Each Charm is run by 
    a trainer called a Leader who guides other trainers involved with the Charm 
    and their Naisuk to become the best battlers they can be. There is no limit 
    to the number of Naisuk that can be involved within the Charm and each Naisuk 
    born in captivity is born to a Charm.</p>
  <p>Charms do not usually have any types of rank unless Sleuths are involved 
    with the Charm. Some wilder Charms may have an Elder presiding over and protecting 
    the Charm from outside danger. There may also be older Naisuk who watch over 
    the cubs and cubbies with magic powers and are usual held in higher standing 
    than other adults. Currently, there are no such Naisuk that preside of the 
    Charm of Nai's Glory.</p>
  <p>Charms are made up of cubbies, cubs, and adults. Just like the total number 
    of members, the number of each stage isn't restricted in any way and as many 
    of each are allowed in the Charm. A Charm is also made up of smaller groupings 
    called Sleuths that are structured more and may have ranks within them that 
    carry over to the Charm ranks. More information on Sleuths and their structure 
    is discussed within the Expert section of Nai's Glory.</p>
