  <h1>Advanced: Introduction to Items</h1>
  <p>Items are probably one of the most fun things about the game. There are many 
    items that can me added to your creature and many times there are interesting 
    effects! Here at Nai's Glory, we offer a wide variety of armor, attacks, potions, 
    weaponry and spells to be added to your creature to change their appearance, 
    defense, and attack abilities as well as their element. These items can be 
    obtained through sales, battles, contests, and hunts.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>Currently, Nai's Glory items are compatible with all NRBC 
    creatures!</b></p>
  <p>When you first obtain Nai's Glory items, they will look like this:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="../items/plants/ng-dayflower.gif" alt="Plant" width="40" height="40" hspace="5"> 
    <img src="../items/bases/ng-armor.gif" alt="Armor" width="40" height="40" hspace="5"> 
    <img src="../items/bases/ng-attack.gif" alt="Attack" width="50" height="50" hspace="5"> 
    <img src="../items/bases/ng-bottle.gif" alt="Bottle" width="35" height="35" hspace="5"> 
    <img src="../items/bases/ng-jar.gif" alt="Jar" width="35" height="35" hspace="5"> 
    <img src="../items/bases/ng-inkbottle.gif" alt="Ink Bottle" width="35" height="35" hspace="5"> 
    <img src="../items/bases/ng-paintbrush.gif" alt="Paint Brush" width="40" height="40" hspace="5"> 
    <img src="../items/bases/ng-weapon.gif" alt="Weapon" width="40" height="40" hspace="5"> 
    <img src="../items/bases/ng-powerpotion.gif" alt="Power Potion" width="40" height="40"></p>
  <p>Notice the little shield icon in the corner of the images, this is the official 
    Charm symbol for Nai's Glory. All items with this symbol are made by me and 
    must be added to your creatures by me. When you wish to use your items, visit 
    the Nai's Glory Updates forum and look at the topic labeled "Bright Promise's 
    To-Do List". It will clearly say in the title whether or not I am doing additions. 
    If I am, I will give you instruction on how to redeem your items for use on 
    your creature. If it says that I am not accepting additions, please wait until 
    I am ready to take them.</p>
  <p>When I do your creature's additions, I will draw a new stage for your creature 
    if need be and alter their stats to reflect the change. You will be given 
    any pertinent information about the changes your creature has undergone. You 
    will also be given patches describing the changes in your creature, like these:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="../patches/armor/ng-backspikes.gif" alt="Back Spikes Patch" width="51" height="51"> 
    <img src="../patches/attacks/ng-bellow.gif" alt="Bellow Attack Patch" width="51" height="51"> 
    <img src="../patches/pawmut/ng-pawmut-white.gif" alt="White Paw Mutation Patch" width="51" height="51"> 
    <img src="../patches/eyecolorad/ng-eyecolorad-purple.gif" alt="Purple Eye Color Addition Patch" width="51" height="51"> 
    <img src="../patches/tailmut/ng-tailmut-gray.gif" alt="Gray Tail Mutation Patch" width="51" height="51"> 
    <img src="../patches/weapons/ng-tusks.gif" alt="Tusks Patch" width="51" height="51"></p>
  <p>These items will reflect the exact nature of the change. Some of these are 
    hard to see on this background, so why don't we put them in a table with a 
    different background color?:</p>
  <table align="center" bgcolor="#666666">
    <tr> 
      <td><img src="../patches/armor/ng-backspikes.gif" alt="Back Spikes Patch" width="51" height="51"> 
        <img src="../patches/attacks/ng-bellow.gif" alt="Bellow Attack Patch" width="51" height="51"> 
        <img src="../patches/pawmut/ng-pawmut-white.gif" alt="White Paw Mutation Patch" width="51" height="51"> 
        <img src="../patches/eyecolorad/ng-eyecolorad-purple.gif" alt="Purple Eye Color Addition Patch" width="51" height="51"> 
        <img src="../patches/tailmut/ng-tailmut-gray.gif" alt="Grey Tail Mutation Patch" width="51" height="51"> 
        <img src="../patches/weapons/ng-tusks.gif" alt="Tusks Patch" width="51" height="51"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>As you can see, these patches represent a Back Spikes armor, a Bellow Attack, 
    a Paw Mutation, a purple Eye Color Addition, a Tail Mutation, and a Tusks 
    weapon. Notice that when set next to each other, the patches join together, 
    like a quilt. In this way, you can make a graphic tapestry of all the changes 
    your creature has undergone. You will receive a set of patches each time I 
    do additions on your creature, reflecting the changes that have occurred.</p>
  <p>Now, one problem with the patches is that edges on the outside look incomplete. 
    To remedy this, Indyana made images for all the outer corners and edges, as 
    well as a blank quilt square to fill in any empty spaces:</p>
  <table align="center" bgcolor="#666666">
    <tr> 
      <th>Blank</th>
      <td><img src="../patches/p-blank.gif" alt="Blank Patch" width="51" height="51"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <th>Top Left Corner</th>
      <td><img src="../patches/p-topleftcorner.gif" alt="Top Left Corner Patch" width="51" height="51"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <th>Top Edge</th>
      <td><img src="../patches/p-top.gif" alt="Top Edge Patch" width="51" height="51"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <th>Top Right Corner</th>
      <td><img src="../patches/p-toprightcorner.gif" alt="Top Right Corner Patch" width="51" height="51"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <th>Right Edge</th>
      <td><img src="../patches/p-right.gif" alt="Right Edge Patch" width="51" height="51"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <th>Bottom Right Corner</th>
      <td><img src="../patches/p-bottomrightcorner.gif" alt="Bottom Right Corner Patch" width="51" height="51"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <th>Bottom Edge</th>
      <td><img src="../patches/p-bottom.gif" alt="Bottom Edge Patch" width="51" height="51"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <th>Bottom Left Corner</th>
      <td><img src="../patches/p-bottomleftcorner.gif" alt="Bottom Left Corner Patch" width="51" height="51"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <th>Left Edge</th>
      <td><img src="../patches/p-left.gif" alt="Left Edge Patch" width="51" height="51"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>When these images are used in the proper way, they will complete the edges 
    of the squares inside, thus making your tapestry look more complete:</p>

  <p>The order of images in the top row is top left corner, top edge, top edge, 
    top edge, top right corner. The second row is left edge, Back Spikes, Bellow 
    Attack, Paw Mutation, and right edge. The third row is left edge, Eye Color 
    Addition, Tail Mutation, blank, and right edge. The fourth and final row is 
    bottom left corner, bottom edge, bottom edge, bottom edge, and bottom right 
    corner.</p>
  <p>You can put these little patches anywhere your want, or opt to just keep 
    text records and forget the images totally.</p>
