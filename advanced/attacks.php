  <h1>Advanced: Attacks</h1>
  <p>Attacks come on pieces of rolled up paper called scrolls. The cost of these 
    attacks is determined by your creature's intelligence level. Here is a breakdown: 
  </p>
  <p>0-49 = Level 1<br>
    50-99 = Level 2<br>
    100 and up = Level 3</p>
  <p>The higher intelligence that your creature has, the lower it costs to buy 
    an attack. The thinking for this is that the more intelligent your creature 
    is, the faster they can learn an attack and the price should be cheeper.</p>
