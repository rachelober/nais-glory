  <h1>Advanced: Armor</h1>
  <p>Armor increases your creature's defense against attacks, it can also look 
    pretty cool! The type of armor you can get depends on what material is offered 
    in Rhul at that time. Most can be made out of steel, bone or crystal mined 
    from the mountains of Eldora. The different materials cost different prices 
    depending on rarity and how much defense it gives to the creature.</p>
