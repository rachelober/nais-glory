  <h1>Advanced: Magic Plants</h1>
  <p>Plants are use before or during battle to increase your stats by the effects 
    mentioned in the columns below.</p>
  <p>They can only be used <b>once</b> and then are out of their effect power 
    and only work inside a battle and the effects are not permanent.</p>
  <p>Items that mention &quot;one turn&quot; actions mean that, the effects of 
    the plant's &quot;power&quot; only work for one turn and after that, the plant 
    cannot be used again. Other plants, once activated, last the remainer of the 
    battle.</p>
  <p>Whenever you start a battle, you must post that your creature has the plant, 
    something like &quot;Ajeya uses the Carrot&quot; or &quot;Ajeya has a Carrot 
    with her&quot;.</p>
  <p>When you use a plant on a turn, you can still attack on that turn.</p>
