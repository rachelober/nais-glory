  <h2>Element of Death</h2>
  <p><img src="../items/espells/ng-death.gif" alt="Element of Death" width="40" height="40" hspace="10" align="left">The 
    Element of Death is a very powerful Element that touches all beings. Those 
    creatures who are strong enough to take on an Element of Death will become 
    more in tune with the universe and will become extremely respectful of everything 
    and everyone around them. Life, to Death Elementals, is poetry, and they will 
    often spend time contemplating the world instead of having contact with any 
    other beings. They are often very morbid, and will spend hours in the darker, 
    more unpleasant areas of the world. Death Elementals will become grayish in 
    color and will often shun the light, resulting in empty-looking eyes, mottled 
    coats, and droopy ears and tail.</p>

    Therefore, any Eorl's Pride elemental plaques/potions/attacks can be redeemed 
    at Nai's Glory during additions.</i></p>
