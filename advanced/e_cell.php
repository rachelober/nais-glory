  <h2>Element of Cell</h2>
  <p><img src="../items/espells/ng-cell.gif" alt="Element of Cell" width="40" height="40" hspace="10" align="left">The 
    element of cell is derived from Life because it is the basic essence of any 
    organism's make-up. Creatures who take on this element are very sacred with 
    life, but unlike Life Elementals, they will fight if they feel it necessary 
    to defend life itself.</p>
  <p>Cell elementals are in tune with the very make-up of living organisms and 
    can communicate with living cells. This can lead them to persuade something 
    to grow, or even to die, at the Cell's wish. They are also very powerful at 
    predicting someone's health, or even their eminent death, due to being able 
    to communicate with the body and knowing how much longer the cells will be 
    living.</p>
  <p>Even with their great powers, they choose to use them wisely. However, Cells 
    can be revengeful and can easily strike their opponent with the most conniving 
    of attacks to make them fall to their knees. One thing to add, with Cell elements, 
    they may be able to cause growth and death, but they are unable to cause or 
    cure disease automatically. They may be able to manipulate cells to grow faster, 
    as in the case of cancer, or cause cells to work a little harder, as in make 
    it easier to create white blood cells to fend off a virus.</p>
