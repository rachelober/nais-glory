  <h1>Advanced: Getting Additions</h1>
  <p>Bright Promise opens additions sporadically and for a set amount of time. 
    This is whenever you can take those nifty Razor Wings and ask them to be put 
    on Spoofy.</p>
  <p>You will know that additions are available if <a href="http://p205.ezboard.com/fnowhererealmfrm42.showMessage?topicID=18.topic">this 
    topic on the board</a> states that additions are available.</p>
  <p>There are some regulations though since Bright Promise is a college student 
    and only has a few free hours a day.</p>
  <p>To help things go smoothly, whenever additions are open, please follow these 
    rules:</p>
  <h2>Addition Request Rules</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>May use up to 3 items (this includes item actions) per creature.</li>
    <li>Item actions are like melting down material you have gained through quests 
      or building armor from Eldorian Crystal. (i.e. a creature would use up 3 
      items by <u>using two items</u>, such as Back Spikes and Eldorian Crystal, 
      and the <u>one item action</u> to put the two together. If a natural melding 
      of items occurs, such as Elements interacting with each other, it will not 
      count against your item count)</li>
    <li>Email me at <img src="../images/email.gif" alt="E-mail" width="115" height="12" /> 
      with the item(s) you want to use, how you want to use it, and specific directions 
      with where you want the additions and colors (if you have these choices).</li>
    <li>If you don't follow these rules, I am afraid I won't do your additions.</li>
    <li>Additions will be open until I say so (when people stop requesting).</li>
    <li>Just so all are aware, I don't know when these additions will be done, 
      but I will try my best! :)</li>
  </ol>
