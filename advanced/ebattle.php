  <h1>Advanced: Elemental Battle</h1>
  <p><i>If you've read about Elemental Battle at any of the affiliates, you can 
    skip this section because Elemental Battle is the same for all affiliates. 
    This is taken directly from <a href="http://battles.indyslair.net/">Eorl's 
    Honor</a>.</i></p>
  <p>Once you've had experience in normal battle, elemental battle will be easy 
    to learn. When elementals battle non-elementals, you battle just as usual. 
    Elemental attacks have the customary damage on non-elemental Naisuk. When 
    two elementals battle, however, there are adjustment factors you must take 
    into account, as elements interact in different ways. The first step is to 
    determine the element of the attacks your Naisuk will be using and the element 
    of your opponent's Naisuk. Then, visit the page for your Naisuk's element 
    and locate the adjustment value for your opponent's element.</p>
  <p>Once you have determined the value you need, you may continue. The value 
    tells you how to adjust your elemental, damaging attacks. For example, let's 
    say that your Naisuk is using Water elemental attacks, and your opponent's 
    Naisuk is a Lava elemental. The adjustment value on the Water page for Lava 
    is +25%. Therefore, you take the damage ratings for your Water elemental damaging 
    attacks (and only your Water elemental damaging attacks, not the non-damaging 
    ones), and you alter them by +25%. If you have a Water attack that does 55 
    Damage, the formula would be (55 + [25% of 55]) = 55 + (.25 X 55) = 55 + (13.75) 
    = 68.75, which rounds to 69 Damage now for your Water attack. Once you have 
    altered all your damaging Water attacks in this manner, and your opponent 
    has altered their attacks in the correct manner, you will be ready to battle. 
    (In this case, the Lava elemental Naisuk would have to alter all their Lava 
    elemental damaging attacks by a factor of -25%... and that, kiddies, is why 
    Lava elementals should not battle Water elementals unless they have some good 
    general attacks and Defense.)</p>
  <p>Now, since Naisuk can have up to two elements, a question arises about dual 
    elementals. If you are a dual battling a single elemental, the adjustments 
    work the same way, and you just have to adjust your two different attack types 
    accordingly. For example, if you are a Steel-Storm dual elemental battling 
    a Water elemental, go to the Steel page and find the value for Water. Adjust 
    your Steel damaging attacks by this value. Go to the Storm page and find the 
    value for Water. Adjust your Storm attacks by this value.</p>
  <p>If you are battling a dual elemental, however, things get more complicated. 
    You must adjust your attacks using the average of the two adjustment factors 
    for both of your opponent's elements. For example, let's say you are a Water 
    elemental, and you are trying to adjust your Water element attacks for battle 
    with an Steel-Storm dual elemental Naisuk. The values given on the Water page 
    are +15% adjustment when battling Steel and -10% adjustment when battling 
    Storm. Now, we average the two adjustments: ([15-10]/2) = 5/2 = 2.5, which 
    rounds up to 3%. Therefore, you need to adjust your Water attacks by +3%. 
    So, using our 55 Damage Water attack as an example again, we get: (55 + [3% 
    of 55]) = 55 + (.03 X 55) = 55 + (1.65) = 56.65, which rounds to 57 Damage. 
    Not a lot in this case, but in other cases, the values will be higher. Once 
    you have adjusted your elemental attacks using this method, and your opponent 
    has altered their elemental attacks, you will be ready to battle.</p>
  <p>Remember, you only adjust the damage amounts for elemental <u>damaging</u> 
    attacks. If <i>you</i> are a dual elemental, you will have to adjust both 
    sets of attacks independently (adjust Element #1 by the value given on Element 
    #1's page; adjust Element #2 by the value given on Element #2's page). If 
    <i>your opponent</i> is a dual elemental, you will have to average the adjustment 
    values for his two elements (get the two values from your element's page, 
    add them together, then divide by two). If you both are dual elementals, you 
    will have to adjust two different sets of attacks by the average of two different 
    adjustment values for your opponent's elements.</p>
  <p>Finally, an important note, if your Naisuk has elemental mixture attacks, 
    they must be adjusted by the average of the two adjustment values for your 
    elemental attacks. For example, if your Naisuk has Obsidian attacks (elemental 
    mixture of Lava and Ice), you will have to adjust the Obsidian damaging attacks 
    by the average of the adjustment values you got for your Lava and Ice attacks 
    (add them together, divide by 2).</p>

    Battlefield. This can be a complicated topic, so don't be afraid to ask for 
    help. Doing it wrong is much worse than having to get help, especially if 
    you later want to participate in Tournaments.</p>

    <b>Notes for Elemental Attacks:</b> 
    <li>For many of the elemental attacks, phrases such as "defense decreases 
      by 10%" are used. Notice that it is <u>not</u> "10% of original", it is 
      simply 10% of <i>current</i> defense.</li>
    <li><b>Very Important, this is <u>different</u> from the way Eorl's Pride 
      attacks work!</b> If an attack says "opponent's next attack does half damage" 
      (or 50% damage), then it applies to <u>both damaging <i>and</i> non-damaging 
      attacks</u>. Only if it specifies "damaging attack" or "non-damaging attack" 
      is it restricted to one type or another. For damaging attacks, you subtract 
      half of the original attack damage from the opponent's attack, then do Defense 
      subtractions. For non-damaging attacks, subtract half from the effect (ex. 
      -10% original Defense becomes -%5 original Defense).</li>
    <li><b>Very Important, this is also different!</b> If you use a move like 
      the "half damage" ones mention above twice in a row, you subtract 50%, then 
      50% of the remaining number, making it decrease 75% and have only 25% of 
      the original attack value. For Eorl's Pride, this is different, so please 
      remember which attacks to use this rule on.</li>
    <li>If an attack says "opponent's next attack misses" and you use this attack 
      twice in a row, it still only makes your opponent miss their next attack. 
      If you use the move before your opponent's double attack turn (they can 
      attack twice), the move only affects the first move, not the second (so 
      their second attack still hits). The <b>exceptions</b> to this rule are 
      the attacks that say "on next turn". These attacks block a full turn, whether 
      it is a single or double attack turn.</li>
