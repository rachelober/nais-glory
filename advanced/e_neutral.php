  <h2>Element of Neutral</h2>
  <p><img src="../items/espells/ng-neutral.gif" alt="Element of Neutral" width="40" height="40" hspace="10" align="left">Neutrals 
    only come around whenever the balance between good and evil has shifted greatly 
    in the world, whereas usually Good and Evil keep each other in check constantly, 
    but if ever a time one is not doing their job, such as a great shift to Evil, 
    a Neutral will show. Their job is to keep the natural balance between the 
    two Alignments and during their lifetime they are supposedly to &quot;reset&quot; 
    the scoreboard. Neutrals are completely white with red eyes and usually have 
    long spikes on their back and long sharp claws or talons. They do not speak 
    much nor show much emotion one way or another.</p>
  <p>Most Neutrals are born as such and taken into custody by an O'rynen trained 
    as a Priest to guard this special child, knowing that an important event will 
    occur soon. For their childhood they are taught special magic abilities that 
    are innate to their element. These elements only arrive to the world as adults, 
    causing many to think that Neutrals are not born but &quot;created&quot; by 
    the higher being.</p>
  <p>For those not born with the special gift of the element, the Element of Neutral 
    can still be found by those worthy and destined to posses such a power, however 
    they must be an adult to have this element added otherwise the power would 
    destroy the mind of the child.</p>
