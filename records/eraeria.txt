Notes: The Living Chest Plate is a mystical gift given to those worthy to bond with it. It is made with a special metal that includes alloy and living cells. The living cells have bonded to Blrudie's body and cannot be removed. The chest plate glows with life energy and has not only given Blrudie higher defense, but also more strength to battle. With time and special concentration, Blrudie can master the use of her new shield to absorb life energy attacks to develop her own new battle techniques.
