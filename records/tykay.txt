Notes: The hidden powder augmented Daiquiri's Intelligence and made him 
develop blue energy around his front paws, made his eye glow blue and made 
certain parts of his body where the Blood Splatter Pattern was added become 
real blood. He loses blood but it does not affect his health. As he grows, he 
can learn to attack with his blue energy. His mental state has become unstable 
from his interaction with the powder.

Owner: TyKay
Redrawn: 02/04/05
Notes: The mixture between the Element of Cell and the Element of Decay has caused Daiquiri to turn into the "Undead" Elemental and lose his original rust markings. The Element of Decay has torn apart much of his body, but with the help of the Element of Cell and the Immortal Potion, he was able to regain more movement than most Decay Elementals.
The Immortal Potion mixed with his Blue Energy to create an extra defense shield around him called the Immortal Aura which added 25% to his defense. The Immortal Aura has helped him stabilize in his Decay Element, he will not deteriorate as fast as most Decay Elements.
