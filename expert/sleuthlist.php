    Sleuth of Turning Leaves</h2>
  <p><b>Trainer in Charge</b>: Jennalyn<br>
    <b>Leader Naisuk</b>: Chokore-to (ng003m)<br>
    <b>Mission Statement</b>: <br>
    &quot;As the Sleuth of Turning Leaves, we desire to grow and form a community 
    of learning and progression. Even as leaves are all part of a single tree, 
    we are all part of the Sleuth. We grow and change, giving back to our mother 
    Charm of Nai's Glory just like a leaf gives back to its mother tree.</p>
  <p>&quot;Also like leaves, we are new and simple at our beginnings but become 
    more complex and interesting as time wears on. We each gain our own individual 
    appearance and, as no autumn leaf is ever the same, no Naisuk is either. Like 
    trees whose leaves turn upwards to catch the rain better, we improvise and 
    adapt to become better individuals, thus strengthening the Sleuth and Charm 
    as a whole.&quot;</p>
