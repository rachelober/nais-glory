  <h1>Expert: Breeding</h1>
  <p>Naisuk breeding can happen a few times a year and only happens under the 
    sanction from the Charm. Breeding is not to be used just to get cubbies, instead 
    breeding is a sacred event to bring strong, new members into the world.</p>
  <p>Breedings for Naisuk require two Naisuk, one male and one female. Naisuk 
    are not mates for life, therefore we only allow each pairing &quot;group&quot; 
    to breed every three rounds, meaning that after they breed you need to wait 
    two rounds before you can request that pairing again. Also, female Naisuk 
    can only be breed every other round, meaning that after a female has given 
    birth, she can not participate in the next round of breedings.</p>
  <p>Breedings are offered whenever the Charm Leader has posted a breeding signup 
    topic in the Exchange forum.</p>
  <h2>Non-Sleuth Breedings</h2>
  <p>Includes situations where parents are not in a Sleuth, only one parent is 
    in a Sleuth, or parents are in different Sleuths.</p>
  <p>Price: 75q<br>
    Cubbies: 1-4<br>
    Two trainers can split the cost of the breeding if the Naisuk have different 
    trainers or one trainer can pay the entire price. If two trainers are involved 
    in the breeding, both trainers must reply to the breeding post in order to 
    have the breeding registered. Mutations are not very likely from Non-Sleuth 
    Breedings, but it is possible if the Naisuk have special genes.</p>
  <p>Each trainer involved gets one cubbie, if only one trainer is involved, they 
    still only get to choose one. The rest of the cubbies are kept by the Charm 
    Leader until they grow to cubs and then are sold to the public. At that time, 
    the trainers involved in the breeding can buy the cubs back.</p>
  <h2>Sleuth Breedings</h2>
  <p>Includes situations where parents are both in the same Sleuth.</p>
  <p>Price: 50q<br>
    Cubbies: 2-6<br>
    During a breeding round, each Sleuth is allowed one breeding spot where they 
    can submit a breeding from one breeding pair from within the Sleuth. Any trainers 
    in the Sleuth can participate in the payment of the breeding as long as the 
    full price is paid. All trainers who wish to participate in the breeding must 
    reply to the breeding post in order to have the pair registered for breeding. 
    Mutations and special traits occur more often in Sleuth breedings and the 
    more members that are in the Sleuth, the more likely that a mutation or special 
    trait will occur.</p>
  <p>Cubbies will be marked with the Charm and Sleuth symbol. The owner(s) of 
    the Naisuk must decide what to do with the cubbies once they are born. Options 
    include: keeping all of them, giving them to trainers of the Sleuth or selling 
    them back to the Leader of the Charm for quox.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Note: Cubbies cannot be given as gifts to trainers not involved in the 
      Sleuth! </li>
  </ul>
