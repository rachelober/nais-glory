  <h1>Expert: Sleuths</h1>
  <h2>About Sleuths</h2>
  <p>Sleuths are affiliated with a Charm. Since there is only one public Charm, 
    Nai's Glory, all Sleuths will be an addition to this Charm.</p>
  <p>Sleuths are made up of cubbies, cubs and adults and usually have ranks. They 
    usually have a Trainer that is their Watcher who gives them help and guidance 
    when the Sleuth needs it. One rank that is needed is the Sleuth Leader. This 
    is an adult Naisuk who is experienced in battle and can lead her members to 
    success.</p>
  <p>It is asked that Trainers who would like to start a Sleuth are experienced 
    battlers and good standing members of the Battling Community. The expectation 
    is that the Trainer has participated in more than 10 battles and have 500+ 
    posts on the Nowhere Realm boards.</p>
  <h2>Starting a Sleuth</h2>
  <p>To start a Sleuth, a Leader of the Sleuth must be decided as well as have 
    at least two more adult Naisuk who will start with the group. In total, made 
    up of cubbies, cubs and adults, the starting Sleuth must have 6 members made 
    up by their Naisuk or Naisuk from other Trainers. The Sleuth must also have 
    a homepage that lists all members that are in the Sleuth with their ID#s, 
    Names, Trainer and URL. On the page(s), please make sure to have a way that 
    Naisuk can join your Sleuth as well as a link back to Nai's Glory.</p>
  <p>After this number has been reached and the page is made, the Trainer who 
    owns the Leader must email Bright Promise with the form below, you will also 
    be asked what you would like your Sleuth symbol to be. This can be a 10x10 
    pixel images that you or Bright Promise will create that will be placed on 
    all Sleuth member's images next to their Charm symbol.</p>
  <p>Name:<br>
    Email: <br>
    Leader Naisuk: <br>
    Sleuth URL: <br>
    List all Naisuk with their ID#: <br>
    Icon: </p>
  <p>After your form is submitted, Bright Promise will review your application 
    and give you any feedback on your homepage. If you asked her to make your 
    Sleuth symbol, she will draft it up and reply to your message. Once that is 
    decided, all members will have their images updated with the new Sleuth symbol.</p>
  <p>When new members are added to a Sleuth, their ID#s MUST be sent to Bright 
    Promise so that she can add the Sleuth symbol and update her records. The 
    new members will not officially be in the Sleuth until this is done.</p>
