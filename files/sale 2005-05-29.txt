Welcome to the Nai's Glory Spring Sale! Here we have a lot of nice stuff since I've noticed you guys have way too much quox! ;)      So why not spend it on some fancy items from Nai's Glory? This round, we've introduced the Class D items, where once they go, they are gone! Get them while supplies last!

I plan for this sale to be open for only a few days, think Tuesday night for closing.

Thanks for shopping at Glory-Mart! :D
