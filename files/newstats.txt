The list below is in alphabetical order. It contains your Naisuk's battle record (wins-losses-draws) and the points they've been awarded.

Life Points are just added to your Naisuk's Life Points (so if you had 100 and were awarded +10, your Naisuk now has 110 Life Points).

Experience Points can be added into the stats Strength, Speed, Intelligence, & Defense. You cannot add into Cunning, since that is the average of Speed and Intelligence. You may add either 5 or 10 to any given stat (no more than 10 and no weird, in between numbers).

You must reply below and post your Naisuk's NEW stats and a sentence that tells me what you did to them (ex. "I added +10 Life Points to Life Points, +10 Experience Points to Strength, and +5 Experience Points to Speed.")

[b]If you add to Speed or Intelligence, don't forget to change your Cunning accordingly (Cunning = [Speed + Intelligence], divided by 2).[/b]

Once you have replied, I will reply back and approve your stats (or have you correct something). I will then put a "*posted*" note next to your Naisuk's name. Your stats are then officially changed and you may update your Naisuk's page and start battling with your new stats.

[b]**You may not start battling with your Naisuk until their new stats have been approved.**[/b]

If you have any questions, please email me (battles [at] mintkiss [dot] net).
