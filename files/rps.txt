***Note: You do not need to have all of your roleplays like this. This is made just for people that want to do quests or make up a storyline. You can have a "free" roleplay, as I like to call them, that all you do is sit around and chat.***

----------------------------------------------------

Ok, in order to have a roleplay where you can get unique items, I am going to suggest this setup for roleplaying with a structured setting, rather than just free form roleplaying. :)

Leader Naisuk:
Roleplay Title:
Naisuk Involved with their players: (max of 3-4 other Naisuk *Players* involved)
Region it takes place in:
Restrictions to Playing:
History to set up this role play: (please write at least a paragraph)
Goal of this Roleplay: (just a sentence or two)
Do you need maps generated of temples?: This is if you want to have a set building for them to check out and need a visual representation for them to choose which way they want to discover rooms and such. You can also ask for a map to be made of a certain area of land you are exploring
Items you want to give away?: This is if you want to give your own personal items to players. This is also the section to write in if you want me to create a special little item your players can find. I won't make super-rare items unless I am the one running the RP.



I have a dumb little sample Structured Roleplay Form in the forum. Basically, you should start a thread with the title of the Roleplay and first start off with a few people that would like to join and are committed to your roleplay or quest.

If you want new and rare items, please check with me before offering the roleplay. Most likely I'll accept if I am not too busy to come up with something new.

After 3 or 4 people have joined, you can start up the roleplay and people can reply and go on your way to have a fun quest. :)
